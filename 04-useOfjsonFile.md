# How do you know if your project is working?

Lets begin to use the package.json file.

# What is the package.json file?

JSON - `J`ava `S`cript `O`bject `N`otation


It is the file that we as human find easy to read. It has attributes which are the {key:value} pairs.
It has its own special format.

# Why are we going to use it in order to see if our application works?

Now we are going to see the relation between these files .gitignore file and the package.json file.

It would be so idyllic if you can observe that both files are so usefull when working with node_modules.
